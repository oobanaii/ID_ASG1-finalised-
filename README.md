Links to the band's social media profiles are also available.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
The navigation bar allows users to jump to the different sections of the website without having to scroll manually.
The gallery allows users to browse through some of the band's photos. 
The videos allows users to check out some of the band's MVs.
The contact us form allows users to contact the band should they want to book the band for shows. 
In the future, I would like to implement slide show galleries for the photos, when there are more photos available. I would also like to implement a chat box for users to ask questions about the band and booking them for shows.

In different browsers and screen sizes, my project does not look too different since the normalise css, flexbox and media queries have been used. 
During testing, I realised that my responsive navigation bar was not working properly. It could not display horizontally when in desktop view. In the end i fixed it. 
My typewriter effect isn't exactly responsive but I dont know how to fix that. 
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
