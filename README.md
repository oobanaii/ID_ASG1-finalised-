Your Project's Name
EXO-CBX
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
This project is a website on EXO-CBX, a sub unit of the South-Korean Chinese boy band EXO. This website is for fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and book them for shows. Photos, music videos and live performances are also available for users to check them out. Users who are keen to book the band for shows can fill up the form at "Contact Us" to indicate interest. Links to the band's social media profiles are also available.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
During testing, I realised that my responsive navigation bar was not working properly. It could not display horizontally when in desktop view. 
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
